title: Activate SSH key (RSA private key)
summary: Setup the SSH Key to use with the current workflow
description: |-
  This Step makes sure Bitrise has access to your repository and thus able to clone your code to our virtual machines. The Step saves the provided private key of your SSH keypair to a file and then loads it into the user's ssh-agent with `ssh-add`.

  ### Configuring the Step
  
  By default, you do not have to change anything about the Step's configuration. All you need to do is make sure that you registered your key pair on Bitrise and the public key at your Git provider. You can generate and register an SSH keypair in two ways.

  - Automatically during the [app creation process](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/adding-a-new-app/#setting-up-ssh-keys).
  - Manually during the app creation process or at any other time. You [generate your own SSH keys](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/faq/how-to-generate-ssh-keypair/) and register them on Bitrise and at your Git provider. The SSH key should not have a passphrase! 

  Optionally, you can save the private key on the virtual machine. If a key already exists on the path you specified in the **(Optional) path to save the private key** input, it will be overwritten.
  
  ### Troubleshooting
  
  If the Step fails, check the public key registered to your Git repository and compare it to the public key registered on Bitrise. The most frequent issue is that someone deleted or revoked the key on your Git provider's website.

  You can also set the **Enable verbose logging** input to `true`. This provides additional information in the log.
